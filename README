This application allows the user to enter a search word and based on this does a
VERY random search on the last 3 tweets to the user handle of the search word and
also uses the google search api for this.

The google search API allows a max of 100 hits per day so is not ideal, but this is merely
a demo. There is also a hook for using the yahoo search but this is the category search and
needs some refining to be of an use. I avoiding using the YQL API since I did not want to sign
up for those credentials.

The top page is very rudimentary with various unused classes placed in the event that
style sheets are added to make it more user presentable.

The Gemfile for bundler is also present calling out the various important Gems used.
